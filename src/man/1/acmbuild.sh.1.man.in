NAME
acmbuild.sh - acmbuild script
SYNOPSIS
acmbuild [OPTION] [-- PASS_THRU_OPTIONS]
DESCRIPTION
A script to automate AutoConf and Make builds.

At the command line level the script offers it's own options and provides that
all other arguments are passed unparsed and untouched straight to the configure
command line. For example:-

	acmbuild.sh --config .. sysconfdir=/etc -- --prefix=/usr

In this case --config is an acmbuild.sh option to configure the project, .. is
the base directory and everything else is passed untouched to configure,
invoking:-

	../configure sysconfdir=/etc --prefix=/usr

thereby obviously supporting environment variable setting and option passing for
configure.

The acmbuild.sh options come in two flavours; action options and enabling
options.

b, c, C, D, g, K and T are action options. -b, for instance will run make,
whereas -D will run make dist. (p just sets the number of parallel jobs make
will use).

The rest, (apart from help and version), are enabling options. Invariably these
are implemented merely by passing an enable argument to configure. For example

	acmbuild.sh --config --debug ..

will run

	configure --enable-debug=yes

That is all. For it to be meaningful the developer must process this argument
in configure. The script does not know if the option is sensible, or indeed, if
it is supported by configure, so, in the above example, if the developer had not
written code in configure to process this argument, configure will issue a
warning and then just ignore the option.

As even --quiet output can be quite voluminous, this script also copies
stdout and stderr to ./build-output.txt.
OPTIONS
-a, --at-only  during testing and for an AutoTools-only install, some build
changes are required. e.g. You may reference an external Java jar in datadir but
in AT builds and installations this may expand to /usr/local/share... So a
substitution is required for this scenario.

-A, --analyzer enable compiler analyzer output.

-b, --build  make the project.

-c, --config  configure the project.

-C, --distcheck  perform a normal make distcheck.

--CC compiler  Specify a compiler to use. Functionally equivalent to:-
.br
bootstrap.sh -c . -- CC=compiler
.br
More ephemerally, as a one-off you can use:-
.br
make CC=compiler

-d, --debug  build with appropriate debug flags.

-D, --dist  perform a make dist.

-g, --gnulib  run gnulib-tool --update. Checks for the existence of the cache
file proj-root/m4/gnulib-cache.m4. If it does not exist the update is not run.

-h, --help  prints usage information.

-H, --header-check  show include stack depth

-K, --check  run make check

-m, --config-menu  invoke menu of configurable options. The only thing fixed is
the script name, configurable-options.sh in the project root directory. Usually
this would be expected to have a dialog interface.

-p[X], --parallel-jobs[=X]  if X is specified then make runs with X parallel
jobs. If X is not specified then make will run with the same number of jobs as
processors. If this option is not specified then make runs sequentially.

-s, --sparse  pass --enable-sparse=yes to configure.

-t, --testing-hacks  some build changes may be required for testing purposes.
e.g. A script may invoke a project jar file which when installed will be
somewhere under datadir, but during testing it is in the project tree.

-T, --source-tarball  perform a make srctarball to build a source tarball.

-v, --verbose  emit extra information

-V, --version  prints version information

Options b build, C distcheck, D dist and T source-tarball are mutually
exclusive.

Options a at-only, A analyzer, d debug, H header-check, m menu-config, s sparse,
t testing-hacks and v verbose are enabled by configure so require option c
config.
EXIT STATUS
0 - Success

1 - General failure

64 - Error in command line
